# Malware-Detection
This repository contains the Python scripts to detect malware Windows executable files. 
The pipeline is a two-step process:

1) Training the model
  a) First enough samples of benign and malware executable files are obtained
  b) The samples are represented as matrices
  c) A convolutional neural network is built (here, using TensorFlow)
  d) The model is trained by running back-propagation over sufficient epochs to minimize the loss function
 
2) Making the predictions
  a) The file that has to be tested for benignity/malware is taken as input
  b) The input executable is represented as a matrix
  c) The matrix is passed through the trained convolutional neural network
  d) The file is classified as benign or malware depending on the output probability of the network
