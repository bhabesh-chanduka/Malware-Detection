# Malware-Detection
This repository contains the Python scripts to detect malware Windows executable files. 
The pipeline is a two-step process:

1) Training the model
  a) First enough samples of benign and malware executable files are obtained
  b) The samples are represented as matrices
  c) A convolutional neural network is built (here, using TensorFlow)
  d) The model is trained by running back-propagation over sufficient epochs to minimize the loss function
 
2) Making the predictions
  a) The file that has to be tested for benignity/malware is taken as input
  b) The input executable is represented as a matrix
  c) The matrix is passed through the trained convolutional neural network
  d) The file is classified as benign or malware depending on the output probability of the network


To run the code:
1) First run the build_image_data.py code to generate matrix representations of the executable
2) Run the cnn.py to build the model and make predictions
